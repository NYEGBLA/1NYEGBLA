    <div><ol><h3>Some historical outlines. </h3>
        <li>Within every society there are rules and regulations that bind all together. For a future purpose, it
            is a custom in the 36 states not only Anloga that at certain seasons particular actions are not
            permitted. Sadly, ours from time in the past get into clashes. Here is some with the other religious faithfuls. <br> 
            When the traditional authorities started our celebrations they refused to stop their
            drummings. The church was ridiculing (the Nyigbla) customs and ridiculing (the Nyigbla
            adherents) claiming they were fetish people. Our celebration will make the town good even for
            themselves but they refuse. <span style="display: none;">so we said they should take their religion out of town. I am Asiapim
            Nyigblanua Eha ll saying to the people, if Anlo town want to be happy in Anlo land they may try
            to come under Nyegbla's rules. Again </span>I am Asiapim
            Nyegblanua Eha ll, saying to the people of Anlo that Nyigbla is not like idol
            shrines in the town. Ok</li>
        <li> 1450 Notsie home of the deity Mawu is well established by this date as a regional religious
            center.</li>
        <li> 1881 violent confrontation between the Yewe religious order and the Christian convert
                Stephano Kwadzo Afelevo occurs in Woe.</li>
        
        <li> 1900 the first effort to bring Christianity to Anloga failed. By this date the Keta hospital is
            established drawing more than 2,000 patients a year from the Anlo area.</li>
        <li> 1906 Awoamefia Amedo Kpegla remembered as a taunch opponent of European influence in
            Anlo dies. Priests associated with two of most influential deities in Anlo ban the use of sails on
            the lagoon.</li>
        <li> 1907 Kofi Hayibor Kwawukume a mission educated businessman becomes the Anlo awoame
            mama Srinua and begins his reign by refusing to abide by many of the religlous rituals and
            customs in Anlo 36 states.</li>
        <li>1954 Reconcilation efforts begin to cool animosities left in the wake of Anloga riot.</li>
        
        <li>1955 united Nations plebiscite vote results in the Ewe speaking peoples of the British Togoland
            opting to join Goldcoast Ghana.</li>
        <li>1957 Ghana (including Anloga) gains its independence from Great Britain Ewe nationalist fevor
                begins to decline.</li>
        <li>1984 T.S.A. Togobo businessman and Advisor to the awoamefiawo Srinua II and Adeladzea l
        dies.</li>
        <li>1985 the church of Pentecoast violates a ban on drumming during the days leading up to the
        Hogbetsotso festival but unlike in the past years their drums are seized by the Traditional
        council in Anloga.</li>
        <li>1986 the Asogli Traditional Area which includes the city of Ho establish the Gligbaza to promote
        local development and local cultural pride through the use of the Notsie story.</li>
        <li>1987 Conflict erupted between Christians and traditional believers and their supporters in
        Anloga.</li>
       
        <li>2007 Nyonyo Atsitsogbi Agboda (Agbowoda) made riot and wanted to be king Sri and this killed some 
        people at Anloga.</li>
        
        <li>2011 Torgbui Sri III - Srinua's first Hogbetsoso was held in Anloga. 
            Some fations of Anloga along with Some of their 
            leaders in disagreement, set the home of Torgbui Ashiapim Eha II n fire over his role in making P. Gboba Chief on the Sri stool.
            From 2004 until 2021, He - Ashiapim Kubi Eha l Nyegblanua(Uraanua) was brought before the courts together with the king and war lords.</li>
        <li>2022 The overlord of Ashante kingdom Ashantehene Otumfour Oseitutu together with Ga Mantse visited Anlo kingdom  during the states annual Hogbetsotso festival.</li>
        <li>2023 The overlord of Dagbon kingdom  Yaa naa Abdulai Andani visited Anlo kingdom during the states annual Hogbetsotso festival. <br>
            Horse was allowed into Anloga the capital city of the Anlo state.

            IT'S A TABOO, TOTEMIC TABOO prohibited 🚫
            
            Since last Saturday I asked questions
            Like
            
            Who make that rule
            What is the reason
            When did the rule begun
            How does it affect us
            Where and where does the ban cover.
            
            All of this has big question marks at their ends. 
            
            Then general confusion cuts across and many are views coming. I took the trouble and asked further the very elders and Kings in the town today including THE MANAGERS oF THE SAID DEITY TOGBI NYIGBLA, some elders and I read some more historic books and I now realize I did myself evil by not seeking to know about my origin.
            
            Not only me. Many are today's generations like me. These are the things I found from my research from the horses own mouth. Permit me to highlight a tip.
            
            :::::::;;;;;;;;;;;;;::::::::
            Before any state activity as done in all societies, rules and regulations are observed and CONSULTATIONS with the gods and ancestors are done. So are our Anlo 36 states. 
            
            Awoamefia SRI III and Awadada AGBESI A II, Agbotadua Kumasah and NYIGBLAnua  EHA II  - the priest says they consult, pray, and pacify the gods. Before inviting the DAGBON kingdom.
            
            Nyigbla himself allowed 
            Because he himself set the rule and thus.
            
            The ban covers only one state in the Anlo kingdom. THE ANLOGA STATE here-in the capital of the kingdom.
            So no problem to see horses in Keta or in the hotels.
            
            Some few 100+ years ago since 1865 horse and bicycle 🚲 is banned 🚫. 
            
            Reason:
            1. That for supremacy of the god Nyigbla, no one must compete with him since he rides white crystal horse across the skies. And revealing to our grandparents.
            2. Security , to avoid the white man from coming to attack the kings and priest since those war times the white men rode on horseback. This enable the warriors to get the invading white fighter ambushed and attacked easily.
            
            3. A convenant of remembrance for what nyigbla god came to do to Anlos.
            
            THERE were lots of bans and rules but as time went by, most were revoked, eased and allowed to fit modern development. Ie no sailing on the lagoon, no cooking of soup 🍲 b4 banku etc, as well as no body sees awoamefia, or the NYIGBLAnua among funny 🤣 others.
            
            At the  year of 1907 when HAYIBOR KWAWUKUME Sri II was ruling, the ban on bicycles was lifted. Awoamefia is seen hitherto.
            
            Punishment for the horse 
            Death and total vanishing into the vast sea.
            Curses on the town should it be a defiant behavior.
            
            Will there be  A CALAMITY?
            
            "NO we consult the gods and ancestors and nyigbla himself. He himself allowed and necessary pacifications were done."
            
            Where is nyigbla b4 the taboo broken?
            
            "Still and remain in the state. Shrine at Agorwowornu/WORNUGA and DZEVIE pedome. In ANLOGA. 
            The clan that it is associated to is DZEVIE CLAN/(BLUE CLAN)
            
            It has a Grove and a Shrine.
            Has a female deity for a wife.
            Another shrine at LAKPLE
            AFLAO, TOGO, BEI (BENIN) AND ADA -NINGO PRAMPRAM
            
            Nyigbla-ve (grove) is located at GAGBAKORPE WHERE ANSECO IS BUILT. 
            One of the founding Fathers of ANSECO CALLED W.J.K. DOE was a great-grandson of one of the priest that served in THE NYIGBLA throne called EHA. [EHA begot Tay Lakle, who begot, DOE who in turn begot KWAME W.J. DOE]
            NYIGBLA royalty land it is, all the way to the lagoon front and his royal farm beds are there till today.
            ANOTHER OF HIS GROVE IS TORKOR-ATORLIA, GBAKUTE which he allowed for NOW TO BE POLICE STATION 
            
            What is TORGBI Nyigbla noted for?
            
            PROTECTION, WAR, GIVING RAIN, COMMERCE & ECONOMIC SUCCESSFULNESS IN THE STATE
            DISPUTE RESOLUTIONS among others
            
            What next?
            The ban is lifted for now. Until further notice.©®
